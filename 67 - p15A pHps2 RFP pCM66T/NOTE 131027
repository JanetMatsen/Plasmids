The final sequence has a C insertion.  I don't think this codes for a protein so it isn't causing a frame shift or anything.  

All 4 colonies sequenced (order # 10-237008766) had this mutation, so I doubt it was a sequencing error.  Sequence the template so I can know where the mutationc came from.  

The planning spreadsheet said I used pJ52 as template for the p15A piece, but I think it must have been pJ53.

Sequence the miniprep again (make sure it is p15A mutated) then if it is, sequence
